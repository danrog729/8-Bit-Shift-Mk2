# 8-Bit-Shift-Mk2

An emulation of a CPU architecture I designed on Turing Complete (https://store.steampowered.com/app/1444480/Turing_Complete/). I designed it with the intention of having as few logic gates as possible, which obviously leads to the design decisions you can see in the code. It has no cache and so accesses its RAM array directly. Future versions will have both a RAM and a cache, as they will be higher bit.
